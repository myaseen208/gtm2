# Introcution
Group testing is a cost-effective strategy for identifying positive cases in a population where the prevalence is low. The `dorfman` function in the `gtm2` package implements the **two-stage Dorfman group testing algorithm**, which includes both group testing and follow-up individual testing if a group is found to be positive.

This vignette explains how to use the function and interpret its output, with a focus on accounting for imperfect **sensitivity** and **specificity**.

# Model Details
## Stage 1: Group Testing
Samples are pooled into groups of size `c`. A group test result is simulated based on the true status of the group:

$$
P(Z_g = 1|Y_g) = \begin{cases}
Se[1] & \text{if } \sum Y_g > 0 \\
1-Sp[1] & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

## Stage 2: Individual Testing (if group positive)
Each member of a positive group is tested individually:


$$
P(Z_i = 1|Y_i) = \begin{cases}
Se[2] & \text{if } Y_i = 1 \\
1-Sp[2] & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$



# Function Usage
## Arguments
- `Y.true`: Vector of true individual statuses (0 = negative, 1 = positive)
- `Se`: Vector of sensitivities for group and individual tests
- `Sp`: Vector of specificities for group and individual tests
- `c`: Integer group size (must evenly divide length of `Y.true`)


## Example

```{r}
library(gtm2)
set.seed(123)
Y.true <- rbinom(10, 1, 0.3)
result <- dorfman(Y.true, Se = c(0.95, 0.98), Sp = c(0.98, 0.99), c = 2)

# Test results matrix
result$Z

# Individual tracking matrix
result$Y
```

## Interpretation
- `result$Z` contains all group and individual test results.
- `result$Y` tracks each individual's test outcomes and IDs.

Columns in `result$Z`:

- Test result (0/1),
- Group size,
- Test type (1 = group, 2 = individual),
- Sample indices

Columns in result$Y:
- Final test result,
- Number of tests,
- Group test ID,
- Individual test ID (if applicable)

# Conclusion
The `dorfman` function provides a simulation-based decoder for Dorfman's group testing design. It is ideal for researchers analyzing test performance under imperfect conditions, and for simulating group testing workflows in low-prevalence scenarios.
